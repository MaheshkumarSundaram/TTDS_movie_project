# Graphical User Interface of the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites:
You need to have the Node and npm (node package manager) installed locally in order to build and run the gui.
Please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install it.

## Technologies used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): JS library for building user interfaces
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app): Boilerplate that lets us setup the app with no build configurations. It comes at least with:
    * [webpack v4](https://webpack.js.org/): bundles and minifies the files
    * [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/): JS transpiler


The section *Available Scripts* below was generated automatically from Create React App. Although it's very useful to know
what each script does, we are only going to use `npm start` to build and run the gui, and `npm run build` only a few times
to build it for production.


### Notes
For now, the page only shows the project title. Soon to be modified.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
